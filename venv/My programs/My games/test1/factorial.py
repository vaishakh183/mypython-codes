#Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
#The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
#Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
#8
#Then, the output should be:
#40320

no=input("Enter a number Rinshaee ")

no=5
j=1

for i in range(1,int(no)+1):
    j=j*i

print(j)
