#Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where
#the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence.
#The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
